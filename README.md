## Legend

Since my friends and I often go out and travel, we needed an app for storing and quickly sharing photos and videos between each other. Searching through the huge Telegram chat was unbearable, so we decided to pick Yandex Disk. But we quickly got tired of it too with its sluggishness and terrible UI/UX. That's how this app, Yandex Disk Gallery, was born.
